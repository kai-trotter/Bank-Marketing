# Bank Marketing Project
Data cleaning is a critical skill for data engineers, and in this project, I applied my data-cleaning skills to process information about marketing campaigns run by a bank. I worked with raw data to modify values, add new features, convert data types, and save the cleaned data into multiple files. This project helped me refine my abilities in transforming and preparing data for further analysis or reporting.

Key Highlights:

1. Cleaned and processed data from marketing campaigns.
2. Modified values, created new features, and converted data types.
3. Saved and organized the cleaned data into multiple files for future use.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation, crucial for effective data analysis and engineering.
